# VC playground

A playground for Verifiable Credentials (VC) functionality on the Internet Computer.  This repo contains an example VC issuer and a VC relying party for demo purposes.  The goal is to demonstrate the VC flow on the IC and enable playing with the flow in the roles of an issuer or a relying party.

## Code structure

- `issuer/..` contains an implementation of a VC issuer dapp
- `rp/..` contains an implementation of a VC relying party
